# Non-MVP Utilities

These are all various utilities that are, unless otherwise listed, kept out of the core bundle, but they are not considered part of the proposal's MVP.

## Advanced cell operators

This is exposed under `mithril/cell-utils`, and contains several various more advanced cell operators. Some of these also have runtime dependencies, so that adds to the boilerplate (and is why they aren't in `mithril/cell`).

- `newCell = CellUtils.debounce(cell, ms)` - Emit the latest value only if it's been at least `ms` milliseconds since the last value has been received from `stream`.
- `newCell = CellUtils.throttle(cell, ms)` - Emit the latest value only if it's been at least `ms` milliseconds since the last value has been sent from the returned cell.
- `newCell = CellUtils.cycle(ms, [...values])` - Cycle through `values`, emitting a value every `ms` milliseconds.
- `newCell = CellUtils.on(target, event)` - Emit events on each notification by `target`. For browser event emitters, this uses `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener`. For Node event emitters, this uses `addListener` and `removeListener`.
- `newCell = CellUtils.toCell(value)` - Converts `value` to a cell if it's either an observable, a promise, an observable-like object (including Mithril streams with the redesign), a thenable, or just about anything else that could be considered async emitting from a single channel.
	- Note that only some things can be ended - notably promises and thenables can't.
- `[send, result] = Cell.subject((cell) => result)` - Convert a cell factory into a reactive subject.
	- This is useful for unnesting `send` callbacks for use in certain reactive loops. In particular, it's useful to do `[dispatch, values] = Cell.subject(attrs => Cell.scanMap(attrs, initialState, (state, next) => [nextState, value]))`
	- Be careful to call `done` in your `done` callback, or at the very least, return `done`!
	- Not sure this belongs in the MVP - it's a pretty advanced use case.

This can eventually include others, too, and is meant to be the catch-all kitchen sink of cell operators as long as they're reasonably useful and not too niche. It's not the main module because you generally don't need these (for example, `on` - event handlers are usually good enough, and attributes), but it's there in case you need at least some of them.

## List diff

This is exposed under `mithril/list-diff`, and is useful when you need to apply Mithril's diffing algorithm before actually rendering the list. This is out of core because the internal diff/patch algorithm is actually stateful and operates on the IR directly, while this is necessarily a separate, second implementation emulating it for simple immutable lists of objects.

- `diff = new ListDiff.Keyed(initialValues, getKey?)` - Create a keyed diff tracker
- `diff = new ListDiff.Unkeyed(initialValues, getType?)` - Create a typed diff tracker
- Diff trackers:
	- `diff.all` - Get the list of all values.
	- `diff.isRemoved(index)` - Get whether the value at `diff.all[index]` is being removed.
	- `diff.update(nextValues)` - Update for next list of values
	- `diff.flush()` - Flush last update
	- `diff.scheduled` - Get the number of yet-to-be-flushed updates

Notes:

- Keys are treated as object properties, just like keys in Mithril's internal keyed diff algorithm.
- Types are compared by referential identity, just like keys in Mithril's internal unkeyed diff algorithm.
- Internally, I'd do a form of generational mark-and-sweep:
	- When adding a key, it starts at the global diff counter.
	- I'd increment all retained values' counters on update.
	- On flush, I'd remove all counters at 0 and then decrement the global diff counter and all remaining value counters.

This is *not* part of the MVP, but exists as part of the necessary standard library. It's a separate unit because it's hard to get right, but several relatively low-level async things like lists of transitioned elements and lists of elements linked to remote resources need it to perform proper caching aligning with Mithril's internal behavior.

## List transition API

This is exposed under `mithril/transition-list` and depends on `mithril/list-diff` (for `TransitionKeyed` only) and `mithril/transition` (for both).

- `m(TransitionKeyed, {in, out}, children)` - Define a keyed list of transitioned elements
	- `in:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning inward.
	- `out:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning outward.
	- `children:` - An array of zero or more keyed elements.

- `m(TransitionFragment, {in, out}, children)` - Define an unkeyed list of transitioned elements
	- `in:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning inward.
	- `out:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning outward.
	- `children:` - A function taking a value and index and returning a keyed element.

Notes:

- The values in `children:` are fed to `m(Transition)` as appropriate.
- Children are removed and re-added as applicable per the rules stated in `m(Transition)`.
- Keys are removed from transitioned elements in `TransitionKeyed` and `TransitionFragment` children when they're actually rendered.
- While an element is being animated out, if it's re-added without being removed, the `out` classes are simply removed, letting the animation reverse naturaly.
- While an element is being animated out, if it's re-added and removed again during that process, those cancel each other out and the `out` classes are re-added.

### Why?

1. Animated lists aren't easy to get right. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to try this first. ðŸ˜‰

## Cell optimization utility

This would come in two parts:

1. Calls to various `mithril/cell` methods could be inlined to avoid most of the overhead in them.
1. Cells that emit mostly-static vnode trees could be optimized to have only the dependent properties updated where possible.

### Why?

Users of `mopt` would also appreciate this.

1. It would sharply reduce the memory requirements of these pipelines, since some (like `map` and `filter`) require no real memory and others (like `distinct`, `scan`, and `scanMap`) require very little.
1. The overhead of polymorphic dispatch would basically disappear, as there wouldn't be any significant call overhead to speak of.
1. Localizing updates ahead of time would dramatically reduce the overhead in patching them.
