# Non-MVP Utilities

These are all various utilities that are, unless otherwise listed, kept out of the core bundle, but they are not considered part of the proposal's MVP.

## Advanced stream operators

This is exposed under `mithril/stream-extras`, and contains several various more advanced stream operators. Some of these also have runtime dependencies, so that adds to the boilerplate (and is why they aren't in `mithril/stream`).

- `newStream = StreamExtras.debounce(stream, ms)` - Emit the latest value only if it's been at least `ms` milliseconds since the last value has been received from `stream`.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.throttle(stream, ms)` - Emit the latest value only if it's been at least `ms` milliseconds since the last value has been sent from the returned stream.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.cycle(ms, [...values])` - Cycle through `values`, emitting a value every `ms` milliseconds.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.zip([...streams])` - Zip an array of streams into a stream of arrays, buffering values as necessary.
	- Note: this does *not* drop values.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.fromPromise((onClose) => thenable)` - Create a stream from a thenable thunk.
	- `onClose(callback)` sets the callback to be called on stream unsubscription when it's still pending.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.of(...values)` - Create a stream that emits zero or more valeus.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.from(object)` - Create a stream that wraps an iterable or an object with a `.subscribe` method.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.from((onClose) => thenable)` - Create a stream from a thenable thunk.
	- `onClose(callback)` sets the callback to be called on stream unsubscription when it's still pending.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.range(start = 0, end, step = 1)` - Create a stream that emits a range of values.
- `newStream = StreamExtras.toStream(value)` - Converts `value` to a stream if it's either an observable, a promise, an observable-like object (including Mithril streams with the redesign), a thenable, or just about anything else that could be considered async emitting from a single channel.
	- Note that only some things can be ended - notably promises and thenables can't.

This can eventually include others, too, and is meant to be the catch-all kitchen sink of stream operators as long as they're reasonably useful and not too niche. It's not the main module because you generally don't need these (for example, `on` - event handlers are usually good enough, and attributes), but it's there in case you need at least some of them.

## List diff

This is exposed under `mithril/list-diff`, and is useful when you need to apply Mithril's diffing algorithm before actually rendering the list. This is out of core because the internal diff/patch algorithm is actually stateful and operates on the IR directly, while this is necessarily a separate, second implementation emulating it for simple immutable lists of objects.

- `diff = new ListDiff.Keyed(initialValues, getKey?)` - Create a keyed diff tracker
- `diff = new ListDiff.Unkeyed(initialValues, getType?)` - Create a typed diff tracker
- Diff trackers:
	- `diff.all` - Get the list of all values.
	- `diff.isRemoved(index)` - Get whether the value at `diff.all[index]` is being removed.
	- `diff.update(nextValues)` - Update for next list of values
	- `diff.flush()` - Flush last update
	- `diff.scheduled` - Get the number of yet-to-be-flushed updates

Notes:

- Keys are treated as object properties, just like keys in Mithril's internal keyed diff algorithm.
- Types are compared by referential identity, just like keys in Mithril's internal unkeyed diff algorithm.
- Internally, I'd do a form of generational mark-and-sweep:
	- When adding a key, it starts at the global diff counter.
	- I'd increment all retained values' counters on update.
	- On flush, I'd remove all counters at 0 and then decrement the global diff counter and all remaining value counters.

This is *not* part of the MVP, but exists as part of the necessary standard library. It's a separate unit because it's hard to get right, but several relatively low-level async things like lists of transitioned elements and lists of elements linked to remote resources need it to perform proper caching aligning with Mithril's internal behavior.

## List transition API

This is exposed under `mithril/transition-list` and depends on `mithril/list-diff` (for `TransitionKeyed` only) and `mithril/transition` (for both).

- `m(TransitionKeyed, {in, out, event}, children)` - Define a keyed list of transitioned elements
	- `in:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning inward.
	- `out:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning outward.
	- `event:` - The event name to listen for. By default, this watches for `"transitionend"`.
	- `children:` - An array of zero or more keyed elements.

- `m(TransitionFragment, {in, out, event}, children)` - Define an unkeyed list of transitioned elements
	- `in:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning inward.
	- `out:` - Zero or more space-separated classes to toggle while transitioning outward.
	- `event:` - The event name to listen for. By default, this watches for `"transitionend"`.
	- `children:` - A function taking a value and index and returning a keyed element.

Notes:

- The values in `children:` are fed to `m(Transition)` as appropriate.
- Children are removed and re-added as applicable per the rules stated in `m(Transition)`.
- Keys are removed from transitioned elements in `TransitionKeyed` and `TransitionFragment` children when they're actually rendered.
- While an element is being animated out, if it's re-added without being removed, the `out` classes are simply removed, letting the animation reverse naturaly.
- While an element is being animated out, if it's re-added and removed again during that process, those cancel each other out and the `out` classes are re-added.

### Why?

1. Animated lists aren't easy to get right. I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to try this first. ðŸ˜‰

## Selector binding

This is exposed under `mithril/select` and depends on `mithril/render`.

- `select(root, selectors)` - Bind selectors from an element to a vnode tree
	- `root` - The root element to watch selectors on
	- `selectors` - A key/value map where keys are selector strings and values objects plugged straight into `render(elem, value)` unmodified as the second parameter

This uses `MutationObserver` with an appropriate mutation events fallback for IE (and falling back gracefully to doing nothing) to ensure that selectors do get rendered to when new elements are added matching them and have their trees removed when selectors no longer match an element.

*TODO: Look at how mutation observer polyfills work to figure out how to fall back correctly to mutation events.*

### Why?

This exists to ease integration into pages that are a heterogenous mix of Mithril and traditional static HTML and/or legacy content. The `MutationObserver` part is to be smart about it so you don't have to even manually render when elements matching the desired selectors are added - even if that selector doesn't get there until well after the page loads, the call still works.

It's also very declarative, and very CSS-like in how it binds views to selectors. It more or less "just works".

```js
select(root, {
	".mithril-date-picker": m(DatePicker),
	".widget .input": {placeholder: "Type away..."},
	"#app-one": m(One),
	"#app-two": m(Two),
	"#app-three": m(Three),
	// etc.
})
```

## Optimizing Babel plugin

Babel's existing `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` would *technically* work for JSX + Mithril, but we could take this one step further with a Mithril preset + plugin combo: we could leave files entirely independent of `m`, so JSX would compile down directly to a bunch of object literals. This would also 1. adapt `m()` calls, so those can be compiled out, and 2. correctly handle JSX fragments, which can just compile to an array.

- Hyperscript

	```js
	// Original
	return [
		m("p.head_links", [
			m("a", {href: demoSource("mithril-redesign")}, "Source"), " | ",
			m("a[href='http://threaditjs.com']", "ThreaditJS Home"),
		]),
		m("h2", [
			m(Router.Link, m("a[href=/]", "ThreaditJS: Mithril")),
		]),
	]
	```

	```js
	// Optimized
	return [
		{tag: "p", attrs: {class: "head_links", children: [
			{tag: "a", attrs: {
				href: demoSource("mithril-redesign"),
				children: ["Source"],
			}},
			" | ",
			{tag: "a", attrs: {
				href: "http://threaditjs.com",
				children: ["ThreaditJS Home"],
			}},
		]}}
		{tag: "h2", attrs: {children: [
			m(Router.Link, {children: [
				{tag: "a", attrs: {
					href: "/",
					children: ["ThreaditJS: Mithril"],
				}},
			]})
		]}}
	]
	```

- JSX:

	```js
	// Original
	return <>
		<p class="head_links">
			<a href={demoSource("mithril-redesign")}>Source</a> | {}
			<a href="http://threaditjs.com">ThreaditJS Home</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			<Router.Link><a href="/">ThreaditJS: Mithril</a></Router.Link>
		</h2>
	</>
	```

	```js
	// Optimized
	return [
		{tag: "p", attrs: {class: "head_links", children: [
			{tag: "a", attrs: {
				href: demoSource("mithril-redesign"),
				children: ["Source"],
			}},
			" | ",
			{tag: "a", attrs: {
				href: "http://threaditjs.com",
				children: ["ThreaditJS Home"],
			}},
		]}}
		{tag: "h2", attrs: {children: [
			Mithril.jsx(Router.Link, {children: [
				{tag: "a", attrs: {
					href: "/",
					children: ["ThreaditJS: Mithril"],
				}},
			]})
		]}}
	]
	```

In addition, I could actually *use* JSX's namespace syntax to my advantage to specify certain native Mithril vnode types, since you can't use `<#foo></#foo>` in JSX:

- `<m:fragment>...</m:fragment>` - This could represent unkeyed fragments.
- `<m:keyed>...</m:keyed>` - This could represent keyed fragments.
- `<m:lazy>{(context) => ...}</m:lazy>` - This could represent lazy vnodes.
- `<m:catch>{(errors) => ...}</m:catch>` - This could represent catch vnodes.

This might cause TS problems, though, so I'd need to verify if they actually support it, and if not, get them to support it. (Short-term, I can just have people import the relevant component string names from `mithril/m`.)
